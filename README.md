# Fake News Detection

A simple and effective web application that classifies news text as **Fake** or **Real** using Machine Learning models. The app is built with Python and deployed using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Features

- Input a news article or headline
- Get predictions from:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Random Forest
- Clean user interface using Gradio
- Deployed on Hugging Face for public access

## Demo

ðŸ”— [Live App on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lavanyabafila2/fake-news-detector)

## Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

These models were trained using a labeled dataset of real and fake news. Text features are extracted using a pre-trained `TfidfVectorizer`.
